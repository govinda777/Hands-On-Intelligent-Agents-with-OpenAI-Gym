# Chapter 3: Getting started with OpenAI Gym and Deep Reinforcement Learning

This chapter helps you get started with OpenAI Gym and PyTorch.

## Python Scripts

- `pytorch_test.py`: A simple script to test if PyTorch is installed correctly.
- `test_box2d.py`: A simple script to test a Box2D environment.

## Jupyter Notebooks

The Python scripts in this chapter have been converted to Jupyter notebooks for a more interactive experience. You can find them in the `notebooks` directory.

- [pytorch_test.ipynb](notebooks/pytorch_test.ipynb)
- [test_box2d.ipynb](notebooks/test_box2d.ipynb)
